# Typolog

## The missing WordPress plugin for type foundries

Typolog is a WordPress plugin that has three jobs:
* Create a data structure for a type foundry catalog (font families & font styles)
* Accomodate font files and sort them by their type (otf, ttf, web fonts)
* Create font bundles and downloadable WooCommerce products from the catalog

It also has some extra features which were built specifically for Fontef[https://fontef.com/], the website this plugin was built for:
* An automagical catalog generator that tries to parse font files (using opentype.js) using their information
* Adjust font sizes to fit them together nicely on display
* Create "display names" for type families (for non-Latin foundries)
* Batch edit prices of entire catalog
* Order font families by collection and mark families as non-commercial
* Define "main font" for family display purposes and re-order font styles
* Add attachments to ZIP files, such as license files and specimen PDFs
* Create external links for fonts that are sold elsewhere

## This plugin is still under development!

Please note that while this version of the plugin is functional (and in use at Fontef[https://fontef.com/]), this plugin is not an out-of-the-box solution for non-programmers, and should be used with caution. Please feel free to fork this project and develop it further!
