Creates a catalog of type families for a WordPress based website, with WooCommerce support.

== Description ==

Typolog is a WordPress plugin that has three jobs:
* Create a data structure for a type foundry catalog (font families & font styles)
* Accomodate font files and sort them by their type (otf, ttf, web fonts)
* Create font bundles and downloadable WooCommerce products from the catalog

It also has some extra features which were built specifically for Fontef[https://fontef.com/], the website this plugin was built for:
* An automagical catalog generator that tries to parse font files (using opentype.js) using their information
* Adjust font sizes to fit them together nicely on display
* Create "display names" for type families (for non-Latin foundries)
* Batch edit prices of entire catalog
* Order font families by collection and mark families as non-commercial
* Define "main font" for family display purposes and re-order font styles
* Add attachments to ZIP files, such as license files and specimen PDFs
* Create external links for fonts that are sold elsewhere

== Installation ==

1. Upload `typolog` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
